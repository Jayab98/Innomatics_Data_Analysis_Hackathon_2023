**INTRODUCTION**
As ElectricVehicle adoption continues to grow worldwide for it's sustainability and Eco-Friendly nature, understanding the trends and characteristics of EVs becomes essential for manufacturers, and consumers.

In this data analysis project, I am going to explore and visualize the comprehensive dataset containing information about Electric Vehicles. The primary goal is to gain valuable insights into the distribution of EV makes, their prevalence over the years, and their geographic concentration.

The findings can offer significant implications for sustainable mobility planning, environmental policies, and automotive industry strategies in a world increasingly focused on a greener future.


**IMPORTING DATASET**
Using Pandas library we are going to import the dataset

**DATA CLEANING**
Data cleaning and preprocessing is to ensure the data is in a suitable format for visualization.

**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
TASK_1
UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS**
Univariate analysis involves a single variable at a time.The purpose of univariate analysis is to understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread of a variable.

**BIVARATE ANALYSIS**

Bivariate analysis helps to find the relationship between two variables. The primary objective is to understand how one variable may influence or relate to another.

**TASK_2
CHOROPLETH**
A choropleth map is a type of thematic map that displays data using different shades or colors to represent different geographic areas' values. It allows us to visualize spatial patterns and variations across regions.

**TASK_3
RACING BAR PLOT**

Refer all images posted in images folders for charts outcome. 

**CONCLUSION**
From the above analysis and visualizations,The EV market has experienced steady growth over the years, with increasing adoption of EVs across different makes and models.

Tesla and Nissan have been among the top contenders in the EV market, consistently producing popular electric vehicles.Electric range and eligibility for clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives are some of important factors influencing EV adoption.

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, the following recommendation can be made:Car manufacturers should focus on improving electric vehicle range and expanding their EV offerings to attract most number of audience
